This October, a <a href="http://24hourmaths.com/team.html">group of maths presenters</a> will be getting together some mathematicians, magicians and other cool people to put on a 24-hour long online YouTube mathematical magic show. Each half-hour we'll have a different special guest sharing a mathematical magic trick of some kind, and across the day we'll have a total of 48 tricks for you to watch and puzzle over (and since it's Hallowe'en, we might even include some treats as well). Details and timings are below, as well as a form to sign up for a reminder when the show is on!

Currently confirmed guests include:
- Stand-up Mathematician <strong>Matt Parker</strong>
- Professional speed Rubik's cuber <strong>Sydney Weaver</strong>
- Popular science author <strong>Simon Singh</strong>
- Many more (to be announced)

The show is taking place alongside <a href="http://watsonathon.com">Mark Watson's 24-hour comedy show Watsonathon</a> (more details shortly), which we hope to cross over with at some point(s) during the day/night. Both shows will be raising money for the charity <a href="https://www.turn2us.org.uk/">Turn2Us</a> which helps people in low-income jobs & gives out emergency loans, including supporting comedians and other performers who have little/no income at this time. We'll circulate details of how you can donate closer to the time and during the show.

30 October &ndash; 31 October 9pm &ndash; 9pm
