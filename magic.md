Magic Show
==========

On 30&ndash;31 October 2020, we hosted a 24 hour maths magic show.

At <strong>21:00</strong> GMT, {% include _trickperson.html name="Katie Steckles" twitter="stecks" website="https://www.katiesteckles.co.uk" youtube="katiesteckles" %} welcomed everyone to the show.

At <strong>21:00-21:30</strong> GMT, {% include _trickperson.html name="Zoe Griffiths" twitter="ZoeLGriffiths" website="https://zoelgriffiths.co.uk/" %} joined us and successfully memorised the results of 40 coin flips. Zoe is involved in upcoming events with <a href="http://think-maths.co.uk">think-maths.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://mathsinspiration.com">mathsinspiration.com</a>, and <a href="http://cosmicshambles.com/ninelessons">cosmicshambles.com/ninelessons</a>.

At <strong>21:30-22:00</strong> GMT, {% include _trickperson.html name="Phil Bell-Young" twitter="philby91" website="https://zoelgriffiths.co.uk/" %} joined us to perform a card trick that everyone could also try at home.

At <strong>22:00-22:30</strong> GMT, {% include _trickperson.html name="Matt Parker" twitter="standupmaths" website="http://standupmaths.com/" youtube="standupmaths" %} joined us to (eventually) perform a very unlikely card trick.

At <strong>22:30</strong> GMT, {% include _trickperson.html name="Zoe Griffiths" twitter="ZoeLGriffiths" website="https://zoelgriffiths.co.uk/" %} took over from Katie to introduce out next guests...

At <strong>22:30-23:00</strong> GMT, {% include _trickperson.html name="Susan Okereke" twitter="DoTheMathsThing" %} multiplied some two digit numbers by 11 very quickly.

At <strong>23:00-23:30</strong> GMT, {% include _trickperson.html name="Matt Pritchard" twitter="ScienceMagician" website="https://sciencemagicshows.co.uk" %} showed us some mind-bending illusions. At <a href="https://www.wordsonwonder.com">wordsonwonder.com</a>, you can find a collection of interviews with Matt about wonder.
